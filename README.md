# cmake-gtest-example
My learning and example for cmake and gtest

# Download googletest from their github page into ***lib/***

```
    git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git lib/googletest
```

# Make build folder, and build it

```
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
```

# Check your tests! (this test is run from the ***build*** folder)

```
    ./tests/ExampleTests
```
